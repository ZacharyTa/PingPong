Made a Ping Pong game that displays the graphics in the terminal for fun using Java

Side Notes:
- The game is not playable because there isn't a way to detech the user's keyinput inside the terminal while the game is running
- Two bots are playing against eachother:
  - Smart Bot(left): Moves up or down based on the ball's position
  - Dumn Bot(right): Moves up or down randomly
